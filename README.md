### [wordpress plugin page](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-download-permissions-for-orders/)
## Description

When someone submits an order in woocommerce,
Later if you add downloadable file/content to the product of that order,
User can't download the new file/content because woocommerce doesn't update download permission for old orders,
This plugin fixes that :)


## Too easy to use
